Dear Jane:
	In your last letter , you mentioned that you wanted to come to Beijing , China . and you wanted me to give you some travel advice. Below, I will introduce some of Beijing's scenic spots for you . The Summer Palace is a good place to enjoy garden architecture and cool off in summer . The Great Wall gives a sense of the wisdom and tenacity of the ancient Chinese.
 Watching the flag-raising ceremony in front of Tiananmen Gate , feeling the flag-raisers day after day of adherence and love.
I look forward to your coming to China to experience these places of interest .
